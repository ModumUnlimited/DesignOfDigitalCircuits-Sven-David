I was able to simulate the bad_ALU and repair the errors.

I have not the slightest idea what exactly I did and whether it is really correct, but the simulation says that there are no more errors and thats what was asked in the exercise, so i won't touch anything for sure.

What is probably worth to mention is that i will not give any feedback this week because if i say exactly what is in my mind atm. i'll probably be banned from this course, so instead of wasting my precious time ranting, i'll rather show you an image of a cute duck.
