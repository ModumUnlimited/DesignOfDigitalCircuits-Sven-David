# Lab 7 - Svens's suggestion

I basically came up with quite the same as @David. However, i had no problem with using "j end" for the summation problem and had no use for "syscall", which is strange since the rest of the code is practically identical.

NOTE: I found this MIPS reference that turned out to be extremely useful. Might be worth to keep in mind for later:
